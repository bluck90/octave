Hello all,

Hope this email finds you well.
It is that time of year again when I come looking for your updates to be included in our year groups entry for the Merton Postmaster.
I know it is a strange time for us all and if anything many are taking the opportunity of collective lockdown to re-connect with old friends.
Feel free to send me anything that you would like included: announcements, where you are now, what you are up to, photos, publications etc. etc. 
Nothing is too big or too small!
If you could send then to me asap that would be great.

Just to highlight two things:

The Big Merton 1264 Challenge,  which you will have recieved e-mails from college about is currently on going - do check it out and get involved if you can.
 
The second thing I would like to highlight is the Merton College Compassionate Fund, which exists to assist members of the College and their dependents who find themselves in financial difficulty. You are a member of college for life so in these strange times I think it is important to highlight this is potentially available. Grants are normally made to assist Mertonians at times of unforeseen financial hardship (which may be the result of unemployment, illness, bereavement, or other changes in personal circumstances). For further information, please contact the Chaplain, Revd Canon Dr Simon Jones.



Looking forward to all of your updates,

Best wishes,

Stephanie
